  - >Create_parking_lot 6: Create a parking lot of 6 slots
  - >Leave 2: Vacate the slot number 2 from the parking lot, i.e. car which was parked at slot number 2 has left the space if there exists no car at slot number 2, print “Slot already vacant”.
  - >Park KA-01-HH-1234 driver_age 21: Park car with vehicle registration number “ KA-01-HH-1234”, and the. vehicle is driven by the driver of age 21.
  - >Slot_numbers_for_driver_of_age 21: Return all Slot Number(Comma-separated) of all cars which have drivers with age==21.
  - >Slot_number_for_car_with_number PB-01-HH-1234: Return slot number for the car with registration number “PB-01-HH-1234”.
  - >Vehicle_registration_number_for_driver_of_age 18: Get all parked vehicle registration number of cars parked by the driver of age 18.


## How to use:
  - To use/test the system/parking lot manager, open a terminal in the folder where main.py file is located and run following command in terminal:
    ```python
        python main.py
    ```
    This will ask you whether you want to give the commands through a file or you want to give it through terminal/stdin.
    1. Press 1 if you want to give commands from a file.
    2. Press 2 if you want to give commands through terminal.
    Output will be displayed on the terminal/stdout

## Tech

The following technologies have been used to build the solution:

* [Python] - Python(v3.7) is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
